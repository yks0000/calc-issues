## What problem should this calculator solve?
Who is it for, and what decision does it help with?

## Region / ruleset
- Country/region (e.g., India / US):
- Applicable law/standard/tax year (if any), e.g., "FY 2025â€“26":

## Inputs (with units and constraints)
List each input field:
- Input 1: name, units, valid range, default
- Input 2: â€¦
- â€¦

## Outputs (with units)
- Output 1:
- Output 2:
- â€¦

## Formula / specification
Provide the exact formulae or a clear spec. If itâ€™s tax/finance, include brackets, slabs, exemptions, surcharges, cess, rounding rules, etc.

## References
Authoritative sources (links to laws, docs, whitepapers, calculators we should match):

## Worked examples (must-have for QA)
Provide at least **3** example input sets with the **expected outputs**:
1) Input â†’ Expected output:
2) Input â†’ Expected output:
3) Input â†’ Expected output:

## Edge cases
Any tricky scenarios (min/max values, zero/negative, leap years, rounding corner cases, etc.):

## UI/UX notes (optional)
Desired layout, charts/tables, labels, tooltips, mobile behavior:

## Priority
- [ ] Nice to have
- [ ] Useful soon
- [ ] High priority

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Matches reference results for all worked examples
- [ ] Passes edge cases above
- [ ] Units/rounding match the spec
- [ ] Includes brief help text and source links in the UI
